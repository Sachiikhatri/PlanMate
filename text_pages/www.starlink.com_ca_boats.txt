Now we have files downloading, Pandora playing, Zoom going and there's no latency whatsoever.” - William D. from Colorado, USA Game changer "It's a game changer for yachts...reliable and fast internet at sea, for a reasonable price. I was fed up with the poor speeds and high prices for VSAT internet at sea. We now have a similar internet service and experience to land based internet providers." - Aaron W. from Southern England Fast "It's a game changer for safety and security at sea. You have access to high-speed weather updates. Updates took anywhere from 20 min to 2 hours with low resolution forecasts.
