This was attained through the prudent use of one-time funding from the Ministry of Colleges and Universities and an immense, collaborative effort to realize efficiencies. While the budget is balanced, a $2.8 million base deficit remains, prompting a multi-year strategy to address it through a 1.5 percent base budget reduction, efficiency improvements, responsible spending, and cost-cutting measures. This strategy ensures readiness for future uncertainties and underscores the Universityâ€™s commitment to financial stability amid external factors such as government policy changes and decisions, demographics, fundraising, enrolment fluctuations, and competitive pressures. Maintaining financial sustainability is crucial to fulfilling our academic mission, serving our communities, and achieving our strategic goals in a dynamic landscape. share post save share post save Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions University Bylaws & Policies Manage UWin Account Emergency and Crisis Services Follow us on X (Twitter) Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
