Key Responsibilities for the Traveller Ensuring claim is accurate, conforms with Policy and that all expenditures are supported by detailed receipts Proper completion of an expense report Timely submission to Accounts Payable Key Responsibilities for the Authorized Approving Officer Duty to accurately review expense reports and appropriate supporting documentation (receipts) for compliance Ensuring funding is available to cover expenses Key Responsibilities for the AP Staff Processing requests in a timely fashion Ensuring claims are in compliance with Policy Non-Allowable Expenses For reference purposes, below is an excerpt to guide you when determining what expenses may not be considered acceptable for claiming against your University accounts. Entertainment Expenses are not to be charged to the University unless they are incurred in the bona fide entertainment of University visitors. Luncheons, breakfasts, dinners, parties, receptions, etc., primarily for your own faculty or staff members, are not proper charges against University funds. Gifts, memorials and donations are personal expenses and are not to be charged against University funds. The Human Resources Department sends flowers on the occasion of a death in the immediate family of any staff member, thus other floral tributes by individual Faculties, Schools, or Departments must be paid for by the donors. Any further questions regarding non-allowable expenses should be directed to the Finance Department. Visa Payables Automation (VPA) The University of Windsor continues to expand its Visa Payables Automation (VPA) program to improve process efficiency and working capital management, as well as reduce the cost of processing cheque transactions. The current pandemic continues to provide lessons and insights by demonstrating the need, value, and associated challenges of working remotely and a stronger reliance on digital delivery channels. VPA provides a solution that supports these needs by ensuring the collection of payments electronically at a regular schedule. As a valued supplier of the University of Windsor who currently receives payment by Visa, we would like to apply this improved VPA solution for our payments with your organization. Specific benefits you may experience when you accept payment by Visa Payables Automation solution: Accelerated payment and improved cash flow Reduced paperwork and streamlined accounts receivables process with less touch points Real-time notifications for each card payment Reduced risk to your financial information as the University of Windsor does not store any banking information in our system for VPA payments Complete remittance detail to support efficient receivables posting No changes or modifications to your existing card acceptance procedures This is an important initiative for the University of Windsor, and, as such, we encourage our valued suppliers to consider enrolling to experience the benefits noted above. We intend to pay suppliers who participate in our payables automation program upon approval of invoices, which may result in significant payment acceleration. How it Works: Upon enrolling, you will be directed to access a secure website to obtain the credit card account which you will use for future payments. In the future, you will receive an automated remittance notification email alerting you of the amount to charge and other pertinent details of the transaction. Then process the payment like any other credit card transaction. To Enrol: To enrol in this new payment arrangement, please have an authorized company representative complete the University of Windsor VPA Enrolment Form for each appropriate remittance address and email it to vpa@uwindsor.ca. Please note, it is important that company representatives completing this enrolment are authorized to do so on behalf of your organization.
