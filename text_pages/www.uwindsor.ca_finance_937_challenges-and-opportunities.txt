After five years of frozen domestic tuition rates, many universities, including UWindsor, have expanded international student enrolments to mitigate budget pressures. The softening of international enrolment has resulted in strained financial positions across the sector. Short-term measures have been implemented, and we are fortunate that the past two years' financial planning has allowed for a 2024/25 operating budget that can be balanced through the application of the Postsecondary Education Sustainability fund. However, more extensive measures must be investigated if the institution is to achieve long-term financial sustainability necessary to ensure our students continue to be well supported, both socially and academically. Together we will find our way forward, addressing challenges and upholding our institutional values. Continuation of the domestic student tuition rate freeze for a fifth consecutive year and until at least the 2026/27 fiscal year. This freeze followed a 10 per cent tuition rate reduction mandated ahead of the 2019/20 year and has resulted in most domestic students paying less now for tuition than students paid in 2016/17. No growth in base operating grant for several decades. MCUâ€™s newly introduced Postsecondary Sustainability Fund investment of $2.8-million for the University of Windsor is temporary in nature, meaning it is not being treated as base budget. International student enrolment, expected to decrease from extraordinary levels incurred to accommodate COVID-19 related student deferrals, has softened more than was planned because of lower than usual conversion rates. The 2024 IRCC announcements have only exacerbated volatility in the international student marketplace and are affecting the global perception of Canada as a destination for international student studies. Uncertainty related to faculty member retirement plans making it difficult to plan for faculty renewal opportunities and the associated regular recycling of faculty salary rates. Inflationary pressures on costs, including collective agreements, costs required to support institutional infrastructure and current service levels such as utilities, library resources, IT system licensing, maintenance agreements, among others are higher now than in the past decade. share post save share post save Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions University Bylaws & Policies Manage UWin Account Emergency and Crisis Services Follow us on X (Twitter) Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
